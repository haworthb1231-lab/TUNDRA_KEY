# TUNDRA_KEY

### **Greetings, Agent C.**

I see you have successfully acquired the repository to The United Nations Department of Research and Analysis (TUNDRA)’s crypto-keys that provide you with access to tutorials and analyses on how to evade scrutiny from the Wuchu Ketao Union. The first key to gain authorization to digital footprint analyses should have been revealed when we privately intercepted the signal of the Artificial Neural Networks program. Utilize the ATBASH cipher function I have provided you to decode the key.

_If you require assistance, you know who to contact and where._

#### note: if you need a second password, recall the verbal password used in _last assignment._It must be in all caps.
###### ( **hint:** Do you remember the name of the AGI? )

#### -- Agent B
